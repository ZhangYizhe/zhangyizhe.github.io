# Abstract

Recommender systems are popularly applicated in various fields now. It can analyze user behaviors or product features to predict personal preferences for a specific user. The development of natural language processing led the recommender systems to grasp the ability to “talk” with users for eliciting preferences more naturally. Compared with the face-to-face psychological counseling process, the conversation recommender system (CRS) is more individuation, privacy, and convenient. The CRS can help medical institutions with preliminary diagnoses. Those users with mild symptoms may just need to go through it to get the necessary help rather than resort to medical resources. With this report, we developed a mental health platform that contains a conversation recommender system. The chatbot contains a set of dialogue flows. Users can be guided by it to complete a mental assessment. The result will be used to establish the user model and produce recommendations. We describe in detail the principle and mechanisms of mental health assessment, dialogue chatbot, and recommendation system in this platform. Moreover, we demonstrated the front-end and back-end development principles and interactions of all interfaces. Finally, we show the result of a system usability investigation.
